# README
This is the README file for all files and folders within `scripts/myna/`

This folder consists of the following files:
* `01*.R` - prepare shapefiles for the mynas native range and New Zealand. The shapefiles are used for plotting, calibration areas, and extracting environmental variables. 
* `02*` - clip environmental variables to shapefiles to create input environmental variable files. This clean up the environmental tiff files. `02_`, `02b_`, `02c` were ran with a slurm script. `02d` was run interactively.
