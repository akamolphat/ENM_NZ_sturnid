# ENM_NZ_sturnid

This repository is divided into different folders for different tasks. Each folder has a README.md file which describes the contents of each folder. This repository is structured as follows:

```bash
├── data
│   └── README.md
│   
├── scripts
│   ├── myna
│   │   ├── blockCV_ENM
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── starling
│   │   ├── ENM
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── README.md
|
├── results
│   └── README.md
|
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

As part of the analyses, two folders are created within this directory, namely:

* `myna`
* `starling`

These two folders are created to store outputs from the `biomod2` R package used to perform ENMs.
